Lo-VINGS: Low Visibility Navigation System: 3 m5Stick C Plus devices connected through BLE

Areas with dense fog conditions and  high-speed vehicular movement  experience a lot of accidents due to low visibility, a solution to reduce the number of accidents is Lo-VINGS: Low Visibility Navigation System. The PoC is implemented using 3 m5Stick C Plus devices, one attached to a proximity (TOF) sensor which would be installed on the car, it connects to the other two iot devices through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), one of which is attached to the servo motor for PoC, but should be used to connect and control the braking system and the last one just alerts the driver by playing a sound on the speaker (separate hat recommended but not required).
